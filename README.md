# Website_Playground
A basic website for our team. This webpage would be used to test our skills and add new features before adding them to our official webpage. So, put in your basic ideas and work towards them. Once all ideas are pitched in, I would put up issues, which will be tasks to implement by everyone and you can start working on them. Webpage building is mostly based on look and appeal, so try to make your work as appealing as it can be. If you find something that needs to be fixed, just put it up as an issue and someone would help you.

## Basic Tasks:
  - Decide on layout, including:
    - Navigation bar
    - Projects showcase
    - Team section
    - Communication
  - Decide basic design
  - Coordinate different tasks
  - Discuss about the appeal of the webpage
